# Kali-Linux-UpdateScript

  This is a bash script that was created to automate the update/upgrade process for my Kali Linux machine. The script by default runs an update command. Afterwards, it provides an detailed menu explaining your various upgrade options and what each one does. After you have chosen your upgrade method it will run the corresponding command and by default complete an autoremove to clean up any obsolete packages.
